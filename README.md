# Avengers Analysis

This project explores the Avengers dataset from FiveThirtyEight to answer the following questions:

- How many Earth-616 heroes are full-time or honorary Avengers?
- How many of them are female?
- How many times have they died in the comics?
- How many of the original Avengers are still active?

The dataset was cleaned and analyzed in R using `tidyverse`, and the final report is in `data_project_final.Rmd`.
